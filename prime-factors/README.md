# Prime Factors

The goal of this exercise is to practice the TDD loop (red-green-refactor) to
compute the prime factors of a natural number.

This is a short, but interesting, kata described by Uncle Bob Martin:

Whatever your design, the input should be a positive integer and yield an
ordered list of prime factors. You are encouraged to start by testing 2 and
working upward to deal with more and different factors. This provides the
most direct and illustrative progression of the transformations.
